                DOM is a bulit in object aka document object model 
                document.body.innerHTML is a sub fx from document built in object. when run it delets everything from the html ade replaces it with its value 
                this code works on dot notation 
                document is an object and document.body means we are accessing body from documnet
                now body initselve is an object thus body.innerHTML 
                so in theory we actually changes the value of innetHTML that belonged to body and bpdy belonged to document 
                document is linked with webpage
                documnet object represents or model the webpage 

                document.title gets webpage body 
                document.body gets entire body of webpage
                {we can have html elements in js it gives html controle to js}

                documnet.querySlector('string{what to get from page}'); lets us get any element form page and puts it into js

                if we replace stroing with button it will get the 1st button element from page
                if we replace body it will get 1st body element from the page

                everyhtml emelent has .innerHTML property thus  documnet.querySlector('button').innerHTML; shows iner html of 1st button

                documnet.querySlector('.js'); when string starts from . it means the compiler looks for class nor the name 

                this is called a class slector also used in
                css to style elements of a specific class 

                DOM combines js and html 


                theres a window function 
                window represents entire chrome window 
                window contains the webpage thus window contains the very same documnet object 
                console is also the part of browser 
                



            */
           // document.body.innerHTML = 'hello';
           // document.title = 'good job';
           document.querySlector('button');
           documnet.querySlector('button')
            .innerHTML;
            documnet.querySlector('.js');
